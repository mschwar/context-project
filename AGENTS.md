# AGENTS

This file is the canonical onboarding and workflow contract for agents contributing to `ctx`.

## Mission
Build and maintain `ctx`, a filesystem-native context layer that generates recursive `CONTEXT.md` summaries to help AI agents navigate large codebases.

## Current State
- **Core Engine**: Fully implemented with bottom-up traversal and incremental hashing.
- **LLM Clients**: Anthropic and OpenAI supported; BitNet support needs debugging.
- **Test Coverage**: High for core modules; some stubs remain in the CLI and config layers.
- **Documentation**: `architecture.md`, `rules.md`, and `state.md` define the system.

## Canonical Rules

1. **Context-First**: Every directory MUST have a `CONTEXT.md`.
2. **The Bottom-Up Rule**: Never update a parent directory's manifest until all children have fresh manifests.
3. **Hash Integrity**: All hashes MUST be SHA-256, hex-encoded, and prefixed with `sha256:`.
4. **Surgical Changes**: Make the smallest possible change that fulfills the requirement.
5. **No Logic Without Tests**: No logic changes without a corresponding test update.
6. **Strict Typing**: Python 3.10+ typing is mandatory.

## Required Behavior

### When working from a scoped prompt
1. Stay inside the stated scope.
2. Branch from `origin/main`.
3. Use `pathlib.Path` for all path handling.
4. Run `pytest` before every commit.
5. If the work exposes a durable workflow lesson, report it so standing docs can be updated.

### When creating or editing manifests
1. Follow the manifest protocol in `rules.md`.
2. Never send binary content to an LLM. Use `is_binary_file()` to detect it.
3. Frontmatter must include all required fields: `generated`, `generator`, `model`, `content_hash`, `files`, `dirs`, `tokens_total`.

## Workflow

- **PR-First Rule**: No direct agent work lands on `main`.
- **One Task = One Branch**: Default to one task per branch/PR.
- **Clean Branch Checklist**:
  ```bash
  git fetch origin
  git rev-parse HEAD
  git rev-parse origin/main
  git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD
  git diff --stat origin/main..HEAD
  git status --short
  ```
- **Session-End**: Summarize what changed, what remains, and any validation side effects before handing back.

## Git Hooks
`.githooks/` contains the `pre-commit` hook that runs `pytest`.
Activate the hooks with:
```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

## Definition of Done
A task is done when:
1. Implementation is complete and idiomatic.
2. Tests pass (verified by `pytest`).
3. Git hooks pass on commit.
4. Documentation is updated (if needed).
5. The PR is reviewed and merged.

## Escalation Rules
Stop and ask for clarification if:
- Two canonical rules conflict.
- A proposed architectural change would break the coarse-to-fine structure.
- LLM provider costs or rate limits are a concern for the task.

## Delegation & Intelligence Levels

| Level | Meaning | Example Task |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| `L1` | Mechanical | Updating docstrings, fixing typos, reformatting manifests. |
| `L2` | Applied Engineering | Adding a new test case, fixing a simple bug, refactoring a single module. |
| `L3` | Judgment Engineering | Implementing a new LLM provider, optimizing the tree walk algorithm. |
| `L4` | Strategic | Changing the hashing protocol, redesigning the manifest schema. |

## Model Routing

| Model | Best Use |
|-------|----------|
| `claude` | High-judgment reasoning, complex refactors, architectural planning. |
| `codex` | Local implementation, unit tests, CLI wiring. |
| `gemini` | Large-context synthesis, documentation review, roadmap planning. |
